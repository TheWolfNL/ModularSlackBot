# Modules
We'll list public modules here in the future

## Making your own module?
see [this page](getting-started-module.md) to get you going.

## Example Modules
* [Hello Module](https://github.com/TheWolfNL/ModularSlackBot-example-module-hello)
* [Reminder Module [WIP]](https://github.com/TheWolfNL/ModularSlackBot-example-module-reminder)

## Getting your module listed
If you've created a public module you can get it listed on this page.
Just create an [issue](https://github.com/TheWolfNL/ModularSlackBot/issues/new) with the label `module-listing` and we'll add it as soon as possible.
