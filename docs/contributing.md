# Contributing

At the moment this project is still in it's infancy, and you can best contribute by making an [issue](https://github.com/TheWolfNL/ModularSlackBot/issues/new) if you think of a feature that you'd like to see (please check if it's not on the [Roadmap](roadmap.md) yet) or discuss features.

Another way is trying out the example repo to build your own module, if you need any features please create an [issue](https://github.com/TheWolfNL/ModularSlackBot/issues/new) as well.

If you are familiar with go, and have some feature in mind, you can fork this project and create a PR.
I'd advise to first create an issue so we can discuss the implementation, to avoid people creating functionality with no chance of it becoming part of the project but also because it might need some changes that are required for other issues as well.
